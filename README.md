# arg-challenge
I am trying to understand argument parsing in python with and without argparse. 

I was recently sent a python file which used argparse to interpret arguments but I was not sure exactly how this worked so in order to understand it more I decided to try to make my own python argument-parsing file without using argparse. This is the result.
